## A bit of History

In the early days, the only way to manage NFS exports was through Ceph-Ansible / OpenStack Manila.

Ceph Dashboard implemented its own NFS export management on nautilus release.

With the advent of the Octopus release, the mgr volume module also implemented the NFS management
in a similar manner so the user could manage exports via the Orchestrator. Later, NFS management was segregated to the nfs module
and became the official interface.

So 2 ways of creating exports co-existed: the official implementation (nfs module) and the deprecated ones.
It was clear that convergence was needed in order to provide a unified and consistent way of managing NFS exports.

## The Convergence is here.

Now in Pacific v16.2.7 release we achieved that convergence so the Dashboard conforms to the nfs module behavior and both
the GUI and CLI reflect the same information.

Let's do a quick walkthrough through Dashboard NFS section.

When you deploy a cluster, you can go to **Dashboard > NFS > Create Export**. If you don't have any Cluster (NFS service) running, you'll be notified about this:

![NFS Cluster required](images/nfs-clusters-required.png)

So let's go to **Cluster > Services** and create an NFS service:

![Create NFS service](images/create-nfs-service.png)

The NFS service is running:

![NFS service details](images/nfs-service-details.png)

We return to **Dashboard > NFS > Create Export** and create an export with CephFS as the Storage Backend:

![cephfs export create](images/nfs-export-create-form-cephfs.png)

We click on **Create NFS Export** button and the export is created. We can see the export details:

![cephfs export details](images/nfs-export-details-cephfs.png)

Now let's create an export with Object Gateway as Storage Backend. If there is no Object gateway service running, you'll be notified:

![no rgw daemon found](images/no-rgw-daemon-found.png)

We deploy the Object Gateway service:

![create rgw service](images/create-rgw-service.png)
![rgw service details](images/rgw-service-details.png)

Then we create a bucket for the export:

![rgw create bucket](images/create-bucket.png)

We return to **Dashboard > NFS > Create Export** and create the export:

![rgw create bucket](images/nfs-export-create-form-rgw.png)

Now we can see the export details:

![rgw export details](images/nfs-export-details-rgw.png)

If we go to the CLI we can see that the same info is displayed:

![cli nfs module info](images/cli-nfs-module-info.png)

## Migration

The exports' migration should be done fully automated by Orchestrator/Cephadm, but in case there is some problem, see the [manual steps](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/44252/files).
